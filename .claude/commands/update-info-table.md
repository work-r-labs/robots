There is a table in @README.md which contains a list of all the robots in the project and links to their associated input URDF/XACRO, processed URDF and USD files, if present.

Make this table reflect the current state of the repo.

Also, create/update a file named `to_process.sh` which is a bash file where each line contains the fully formed command `bash process.sh INPUT_FILE` which needs to be run for all the unprocessed robots.
